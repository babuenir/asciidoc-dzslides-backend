= dzslides backend for AsciiDoc

An AsciiDoc backend that renders the AsciiDoc source as a dzslides presentation.
dzslides is modern presentation framework based on HTML5 and CSS3.

This backend is designed to work specifically with the following fork of the
dzslides project: https://github.com/mojavelinux/dzslides.

== Installation

To install the dzslides backend, install it into asciidoc backends through git
(you will need AsciiDoc version 8.6.6 or newer):

----
mkdir -p ~/.asciidoc/backends/
cd ~/.asciidoc/backends/
git clone https://github.com/mojavelinux/asciidoc-dzslides-backend.git dzslides
----

Next, checkout the mojavelinux/dzslides repo inside some directory out of current git tree (ie: `~/opt/`):

----
cd ~/opt/
git clone https://github.com/mojavelinux/dzslides.git
cd ~/.asciidoc/backends/dzslides/
ln -s ~/opt/dzslides .
----

If you enable the linkcss attribute, then the symlink should be added in the
same directory as the presentation.

== Usage

Use the 'dzslides' backend as you would the built-in backends.

== Example

As you would expect, the rendered output looks just like any other dzslides presentation.

Refer to http://mojavelinux.github.com/decks[these presentations] to see examples of the rendered output and the AsciiDoc source that produced them using this backend.
